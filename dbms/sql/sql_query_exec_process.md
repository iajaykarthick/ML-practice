# How SQL Queries are Processed by a DBMS

Understanding the processing of SQL queries by a Database Management System (DBMS) is crucial for developing efficient queries and diagnosing performance issues. The execution order of SQL commands differs from their writing order, offering insights into optimization opportunities.

## Stages of SQL Query Processing

1. **Parsing**: Initial syntax check and verification of table and column existence.
2. **Preparation/Compilation**: Compilation into an internal form, like an execution plan.
3. **Optimization**: Selection of the most efficient execution plan based on cost estimation.
4. **Execution**: Actual data retrieval, processing, and result set return.

## Logical Order of SQL Clause Execution

The logical sequence in which a DBMS executes different parts of a SQL query:

1. **FROM clause**: Identifies base tables, applies joins, and cross-database links.
2. **WHERE clause**: Filters rows before grouping and aggregations.
3. **GROUP BY clause**: Groups rows that passed the WHERE filter.
4. **HAVING clause**: Filters groups based on aggregation conditions.
5. **SELECT clause**: Projects columns and calculates expressions.
6. **DISTINCT clause**: Removes duplicates if `DISTINCT` is specified.
7. **ORDER BY clause**: Sorts the result set as specified.
8. **LIMIT/OFFSET clause**: Applies limit and offset, truncating the result set accordingly.

Understanding this order helps in structuring queries efficiently, minimizing the data processed at each step, and optimizing performance.
