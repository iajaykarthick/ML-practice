    "We can see that the quadratic form is affected by the magnitude of the weight vector. Maximizing the weight vector's magnitude increases the quadratic form, but such influence is undesirable. Our objective is to compute the maxima or minima of the quadratic form, which should be primarily influenced by the matrix.\n",

If the vectors used have different scales, the resulting quadratic form can be heavily influenced by the magnitude of the vectors. Normalizing the vectors ensures that the quadratic form is primarily influenced by the matrix rather than the scale of the vectors.\n",
