# Ensemble Learning

## Overview
- **Definition**: Ensemble learning is a machine learning paradigm where multiple models (often called "weak learners") are trained to solve the same problem and combined to get better results.
- **Goal**: The main goal is to improve the performance of a model by training multiple models and combining their predictions.

## Key Concepts
- **Weak Learner**: A model that is only slightly correlated with the true classification.
- **Strong Learner**: An ensemble of weak learners that collectively produce a robust model.

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Aggregation Methods**: The most common methods for combining the predictions from different models are:
  - **Majority Voting**: Each model votes and the most common prediction is chosen.
  - **Averaging**: For regression tasks, the average of all model predictions is used.
  - **Weighted Averaging**: Each model's prediction is given a weight based on its performance.

## Types of Ensemble Methods
1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: 
   - Reduces variance of individual models in the ensemble.
   - Example: Random Forest.
2. **Boosting**: 
   - Converts weak learners into strong learners.
   - Sequentially builds weak learners, each correcting its predecessor.
   - Example: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting.
3. **Stacking**: 
   - Learners are combined using another learning algorithm.
   - Different types of algorithms can be used as base learners.

## Advantages
- **Improved Accuracy**: Combines predictions from multiple models, often leading to more accurate results.
- **Reduced Overfitting**: Especially with bagging methods.
- **Handles Various Data Types**: Effective for diverse datasets and tasks.

## Disadvantages
- **Increased Complexity**: More complex to implement and understand than individual models.
- **Computationally Intensive**: Requires more computational resources.
- **Model Interpretability**: Ensemble models are usually harder to interpret than individual models.

## Applications
- **Classification and Regression Tasks**: Widely used in various real-world scenarios like fraud detection, risk assessment, and customer segmentation.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most important features in high-dimensional datasets.
